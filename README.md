# node-enocean-server-template
a template for a full enocean home automation server.
to use it clone this repository:

    https://github.com/Holger-Will/node-enocean-server-template.git

then

    cd node-enocean-server-template
    npm install
    cd webapp
    bower install
    cd ..
    node index.js
  
and you are up and running.    
you now have a very rudimentary enocean telegram monitor, a generic switch and a generic dimmer.    
You can now edit webapp/index.html to create your very own personal home automation controller.
